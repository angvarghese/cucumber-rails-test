This is a completely bare-bones Rails app that serves one single purpose:

h2. Test that Cucumber works with Ruby on Rails

Here is how:

<pre># Install gems
sudo gem install webrat rspec rspec-rails
git clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_rails.git
cd cucumber_rails
rake
</pre>

The default task will vendor copies of Rails and Cucumber the first time it is run,
and pull changes after that. If you'd like to start fresh, just delete the vendor/rails
and vendor/plugins/cucumber directories and run rake again.

To Test with a specific version of Rails, e.g. 2.2.2:
<pre># Make sure you have a vendored copy of Rails and Cucumber
rake cucumber_test:update
rake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test
</pre>

</pre># Test test with Spork:
CUCUMBER_GENERATE_OPTS=--spork rake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test
</pre>

If it's green, everything is OK. If not, you should see red.

To see a list of all available testing tasks, run <code>rake -T cucumber_test</code>

h2. Adding new features

The <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks will *REVERT ALL LOCAL CHANGES* when run. Therefore, if you're modifying things, I recommend you don't run this task, but <code>rake features</code> instead. Then *MAKE SURE YOU ADD AND COMMIT* the files you changed before you run any of the <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks again. Make sure you don't add too much. The files that are generated should *not* be added to Git.
