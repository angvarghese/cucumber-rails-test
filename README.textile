This is a completely bare-bones Rails app that serves one single purpose:

h2. Test that Cucumber works with Ruby on Rails

Here is how:

<pre>git clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_rails.git
cd cucumber_rails
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Get the most recent Cucumber - the submodule def might point to an older version
pushd vendor/plugins/cucumber
git checkout master
git pull origin master
popd

# Install gems
sudo gem install aslakhellesoy-webrat rspec rspec-rails

rake cucumber_test:all
</pre>

If it's green, everything is OK. If not, you should see red.

This will use whatever Rails gem you have installed. 
If you want to run against the Rails Edge, get the latest Rails in a similar fashion to getting
the latest Cucumber. Then make a symlink from rails to edge_rails and run the tests again.

TODO: Rename to rails and just checkout the tag.
