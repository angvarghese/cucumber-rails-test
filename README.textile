This is a completely bare-bones Rails app that serves one single purpose:

h2. Test that Cucumber works with Ruby on Rails

Here is how:

<pre>git clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_rails.git
cd cucumber_rails
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Get the most recent Cucumber - the submodule def might point to an older version
pushd vendor/plugins/cucumber
git checkout master
git pull origin master
popd

# Install gems
sudo gem install webrat rspec rspec-rails

# See available tasks
rake -T cucumber

# Test with e.g Rails 2.2.2 - this will checkout the tagged rails version
rake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test

# To test with Spork:
CUCUMBER_GENERATE_OPTS=--spork rake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test
</pre>

If it's green, everything is OK. If not, you should see red.

h2. Adding new features

The <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks will *REVERT ALL LOCAL CHANGES* when run. Therefore, if you're modifying things, I recommend you don't run this task, but <code>rake features</code> instead. Then *MAKE SURE YOU ADD AND COMMIT* the files you changed before you run any of the <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks again. Make sure you don't add too much. The files that are generated should *not* be added to Git.
